Found data online about Boston real estate home prices. Started to sort through the data and research real estate formulas to add into the data set. Starting to create new variables that will allow users to evaluate real estate and find out if it is a good or bad investment/deal.

Worked on creating an interactive map to allow users to see each porperty. I am trying to add markers to the map that allows users to get general statistics on each house like price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. Additionally, I found average NOI of houses in the boston area from a Umass real estate blog. With that I created a new variable in the data set called cap rate, which is a common stat for real estate investors to look at. I think I will use this cap rate primarily on the multifamily homes in this data set.

I continued to work on the interactive map for properties in Boston. I added labels so that you can hover over the property and get its address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, etc. Working on trying to get the labels to display vertically and not horizontally.

I did some more research on the statistics and formulas that many real estate investors look at when purchasing a property. I filtered the data set to just multifamily homes and began working on interactive plots to allow investors to not only analyze the data but identify properties based on their address.

I continued to work on the Multi-Family Analysis section of my project. I fixed a few of the errors I made from my work outside of class in creating the statistics, although I may need to take another look at that. I created a couple more interactive plots that allows a user to look analyze the table and identify an address of a property. Finally, I created a couple of tables as well that allows users to look at a plot and a table. I am beginning to create a table that will allow me to show the variablity of all these stats for Boston properties.
