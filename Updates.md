Found data online about Boston real estate home prices. Started to sort through the data and research real estate formulas to add into the data set. Starting to create new variables that will allow users to evaluate real estate and find out if it is a good or bad investment/deal. 

##March 28 Beginning of Class
Worked on creating an interactive map to allow users to see each porperty. I am trying to add markers to the map that allows users to get general statistics on each house like price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. Additionally, I found average NOI of houses in the boston area from a Umass real estate blog. With that I created a new variable in the data set called cap rate, which is a common stat for real estate investors to look at. I think I will use this cap rate primarily on the multifamily homes in this data set.

I continued to work on the interactive map for properties in Boston. I added labels so that you can hover over the property and get its address, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, etc. Working on trying to get the labels to display vertically and not horizontally. 

##March 30 Beginning of Class
I did some more research on the statistics and formulas that many real estate investors look at when purchasing a property. I filtered the data set to just multifamily homes and began working on interactive plots to allow investors to not only analyze the data but identify properties based on their address.

I continued to work on the Multi-Family Analysis section of my project. I fixed a few of the errors I made from my work outside of class in creating the statistics, although I may need to take another look at that. I created a couple more interactive plots that allows a user to look analyze the table and identify an address of a property. Finally, I created a couple of tables as well that allows users to look at a plot and a table. I am beginning to create a table that will allow me to show the variablity of all these stats for Boston properties. 

##April 4 Beginning of Class
I moved on to an analysis of Condo properties for sale in Boston. I completed that analysis and then went on to researching how to change some of the aspects of the interactive map that I made at the start of this project. I have to apply some of the things I found and do a more general analysis of Boston real estate and show some of the variablity in the data. 

##April 4 End of Class
I worked on the condo analysis and the single family analysis for my project. Additionally, I started to work on the general analysis of Boston. I will show the varied prices for property types and will use this analysis to compare the overall Boston real estate market with other major cities across the country. 

##April 6 Beginning of Class
I continued to work on general Boston housing data set. I created plots that showed the variability of home prices in the city based on the property type. I did run into some issues that took some time to fix, but I managed to figure them all out. I then began searching for new data sets for New York. To be honest I thought these would be easier to find but it is turning out to be a little more difficult to find data sets with good variables. 

##April 6 End of Class
I finished up the Boston general analysis. I found a nyc data set on Kaggle for the NYC portion of my project. I looked through the data and tried to figure out the best way to simplify the data set so that I could use it for more analysis. I ended up deciding to rename the variable I need and put all the different building classifications that NYC has into more broad categories.
