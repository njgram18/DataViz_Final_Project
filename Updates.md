Found data online about Boston real estate home prices. Started to sort through the data and research real estate formulas to add into the data set. Starting to create new variables that will allow users to evaluate real estate and find out if it is a good or bad investment/deal.

Worked on creating an interactive map to allow users to see each porperty. I am trying to add markers to the map that allows users to get general statistics on each house like price, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. Additionally, I found average NOI of houses in the boston area from a Umass real estate blog. With that I created a new variable in the data set called cap rate, which is a common stat for real estate investors to look at. I think I will use this cap rate primarily on the multifamily homes in this data set.
