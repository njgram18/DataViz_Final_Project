Classmate Projects

##March 23 Sean Hauck

Sean is creating a shiny app similar to the FIFA player comparisons that you see. It seems like a very interesting and challenging project. He is currently finding player data to allow the user to make any combination of players possible. Since there are so many professional players in the world that seems like his most difficult problem at the moment.

Kyle is working on a shiny app breaks down NFL player stats. He is currently working just with the Philadelphia Eagles receivers, but plans on expanding it to different positions and possibly teams. The data set is very large so he is running into some trouble with organizing it and keeping the relevant information.
