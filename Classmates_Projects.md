Classmate Projects

##March 23 Sean Hauck

Sean is creating a shiny app similar to the FIFA player comparisons that you see. It seems like a very interesting and challenging project. He is currently finding player data to allow the user to make any combination of players possible. Since there are so many professional players in the world that seems like his most difficult problem at the moment. 

##March 28 Kyle
Kyle is working on a shiny app breaks down NFL player stats. He is currently working just with the Philadelphia Eagles receivers, but plans on expanding it to different positions and possibly teams. The data set is very large so he is running into some trouble with organizing it and keeping the relevant information. 

##March 30 Meyer
He is working on a shiny app to analyze a bunch of MLS soccer data. Right now he has the app set up to for the user to pick and conference and then a team and get a bunch of different tables and plots to analyze player stats. One thing I asked him was if he was going to update the data near the end of the project because the MLS season just started so many of the plots/data is stacked on top of each other. He said that would probably be his plan. He also had some interesting data on team value that he may or may not incorporate into his shiny app. 

##April 4th Hamblen
He is working on a shiny app about golfer statistics. The user can pick a torunament and get results on the last 7 winners and their final scores. He said that one issue he is having is for players who have multiple wins at the same tournament within this span. HE was working on creating a new variable for that. Additionally, he mentioned that the data was from a fantasy golf app, so there was a lot of unwanted junk that he has been slowly getting rid of.
